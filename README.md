# Extravaganza Management

We are going to change the world.

## Workflow/Ideas

We have two major options here, either use id scanning at the door/in the TLC queue or enter ticket numbers to check people in.

no idea what scanner workflow would look like but numbers is something like:
* Enter full name with ticket numbers when we give them away at the booth
* at checkin table/TLC queue there is a guy with the app open who enters the ticket number and then boom you are checked in
* attendees keep tickets, can do the coatcheck with the same ticket with the number, and we get more stamps?? yeah need stamps
* use ticket to get coat back, but can use name lookup because we have the name from ticket distro
* have fun


## Development

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev:open
```

## Building

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
